HowTos and Practical Guides
===========================



This section contains a curated collection of **HowTos** and short guides for EasyNavigation (EasyNav).  
Each document provides stepâ€‘byâ€‘step instructions to accomplish specific tasks â€” from setting up costmaps to configuring controllers and running navigation examples.

If you are new to EasyNav, we recommend starting with :doc:`../getting_started/index` and :doc:`../build_install/index` before diving into these guides.

ðŸ“˜ Overview
-----------

The HowTos are grouped by category:

- **Simple navigation** â€“ basic examples using the Simple stack.
- **Costmap navigation** â€“ using 2D costmaps for mapping and planning.
- **GridMap navigation** â€“ elevationâ€‘aware mapping and path planning.
- **Controllers** â€“ configuring and tuning controllers for different robots.
- **Behaviors** â€“ using extternally EasyNav from any application or behavior.
- **General** - ways to do some something, more or less independ from the stack.

Use these guides as templates or quick references while developing with EasyNav.
