Overview
########

**EasyNavigation (EasyNav)** is an open-source navigation system for ROS 2, designed to be:

- âœ… **Representation-agnostic**, supporting a wide variety of environment models: 2D costmaps, elevation-aware gridmaps, Octomap-based 3D representations, raw point clouds, or hybrid combinations.
- âš¡ **Real-time capable**, minimizing latency between perception and action.
- ðŸ§© **Modular**, through a plugin architecture and reusable navigation stacks.
- ðŸš€ **Lightweight and simple to deploy**, using a single binary and a parameter file for configuration.
- ðŸ§ª **Simulation-ready**, thanks to a rich collection of **PlayGrounds** with different robots and environments.

EasyNav is developed by the `Intelligent Robotics Lab <https://intelligentroboticslab.gsyc.urjc.es/>`_ at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos and aims to be a flexible, extensible, and practical alternative to existing ROS 2 navigation stacks like Nav2.

We believe in Open Source and in giving the community multiple options to choose from, that adapt to different scenarios and constraints. **EasyNav is not intended to replace Nav2**, which we admire and take as inspiration. Instead, it aims to offer flexibility and meet specific requirements in areas where Nav2 might be less suitable.

It is structured around:

- A **core**, responsible for real-time data processing and behavior execution.
- **Stacks**, which specialize the system for different environment types or use cases.
- **Plugins**, that define localization, path planning, control, and map representation methods.
- **PlayGrounds**, which offer complete simulation scenarios with robots, maps, and example configurations.

Whether you are building robots for indoor or outdoor environments, structured or unstructured terrains, EasyNav provides the flexibility and performance needed to achieve robust autonomous navigation.
