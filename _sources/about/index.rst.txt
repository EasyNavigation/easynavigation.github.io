About
=====

**EasyNavigation (EasyNav)** is an open-source navigation system for ROS 2, developed by the Intelligent Robotics Lab at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos. Its goal is to provide a lightweight, real-time-capable alternative to Nav2 that is agnostic to the internal representation of the robot's environment.

We welcome contributions from the community, whether through issues, pull requests, or ideas. EasyNav is developed and maintained by a dedicated group of researchers, developers, and collaborators. We would like to thank all current and past contributors.

If you or your organization are interested in supporting the development or use of EasyNav, feel free to contact the project lead.
